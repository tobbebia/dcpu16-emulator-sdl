This is an emulator for the DCPU16 CPU of Notch's new game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com).
Supports DCPU16 according to specification version 1.7 released by Notch.
Project source code can be found at: https://github.com/tobbebia/dcpu16-emulator and https://github.com/tobbebia/dcpu16-emulator-sdl
Collaborators: tobbebia, skyfell
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILDING:
Use 'make all'. Output file will be found in /bin.

RUNNING:
Terminal 'dcpu16 parameters ram_file'.

	PARAMETERS:
		-d	debug mode (let's you step through the instructions)
		-bl	ram file is in binary format with little endian words
		-bb	ram file is in binary format with big endian words
		-p	enable profiling
		<file>	file which gets loaded to ram

	EXAMPLES:
		dcpu16sdl -bl AtlasOS.bin
		dcpu16sdl 3d.hex
		dcpu16sdl -p 3d.hex
		dcpu16sdl -d -bl my_program.bin

NOTE:
When running in normal mode (not debug mode), the emulator will run forever and it is hard to see the results of your program.

EXTRA OPCODES:

0x18 - Breakpoint. Let's you explore the CPU state and then continue. Interrupts will be ignored when
	the DCPU is on a breakpoint.

USING THIS EMULATOR AS A CORE IN YOUR OWN PROJECTS (I.E. GUI EMULATORS):
1. Change MAIN variable in Makefile and provide your own C file with a main function.
2. Optionally set the ADDITIONAL_CFILES and ADDITIONAL_CFLAGS in Makefile.
2. Set the desired configuration in config.h.
3. Run 'make all' to build a binary.
